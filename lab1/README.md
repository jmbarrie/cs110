# Overview

This was implemented with my limited knowledge of HTML. Something I did a bit
differently than the detailed explanations was using a grid for the tweet section
and for the right section as well.

# Issues

While testing on my local device, I noticed that the media querry was not working
on Google Chrome. But, it was working on other browsers like Safari and VSCode's
HTML Preview extension. I cannot explain why this may be the case, but could not
figure out what is causing this bug.
