## Interesting Findings
- HTML class "tweet" to input data gathered from JSON?

## React.js
- There must be a middleware that converts React code into HTML/CSS/JS

### Components
- All components must call a `render` - it is called when an object is 
instantiated for the first time.

#### Constructor
- Call super() to ensure that we are calling the React constructor
- Use `this.state = {}` to instantiate a JSON object that holds member variables
