# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game using Javascript. This project was completed for UCR's
CS110 Web Development course.

To play simply open the index.html file and have fun. When a player wins a round
the board is immediately refreshed. Otherwise, players can hit the New Game 
button to refresh the board. Each win will add to a players score which can be 
reset using the Reset button.
